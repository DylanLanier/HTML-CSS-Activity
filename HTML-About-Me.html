            My name is Dylan Lanier, and I am a non-traditional student at University of Nebraska at Omaha. I have one year left before graduation, mostly consisting of the IT specific coursework because I transferred in the majority of my general education credits. Prior to coming back to school for Management Information Systems I worked as a retail manager for Walmart for about 8 years. As you can see by my photo, I was a very serious manager at all times. It has been a fairly major shift to go from people management and business decisions to learning everything that is needed to succeed in the IT field. Outside of school I enjoy spending time outdoors, reading, watching movies, playing video games, and I practice martial arts at a local gym.
