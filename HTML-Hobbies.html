                    When I'm not doing schoolwork I enjoy spending time at my local Kung-Fu gym. I am currently an Orange sash about to test for Blue, but I enjoy the workout so the sash level is secondary. Another hobby of mine is hiking outdoors, as shown in this picture my wife and I took at Ramona Falls in Mount Hood National Forest when we were in Oregon. Unfortunately I do not get out hiking as much as I would like, especially because getting anywhere scenic from home requires a bit of travel.

                    I also enjoy playing video games. Some of my current favorites have been:

                <ul>
                    <li>Dead by Daylight</li>
                    <li>Raft</li>
                    <li>Among Us</li>
                    <li>Final Fantasy XIV: Online</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As a bonus, here is a picture from my recent vacation to the Timberline Lodge, which was used as the exterior of the Overlook Hotel in Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film adaptation of Stephen King's <i>The Shining</i>.
